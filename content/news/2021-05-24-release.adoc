We're happy to announce a new release of ClojureScript. If you're an existing
user of ClojureScript please read over the following release notes carefully.

## Noteworthy Changes

* Closure Compiler has been updated to `v20210505`

## New Core Features

### `and` / `or` Optimization as Compiler Pass

ClojureScript generates efficient JavaScript for `and` / `or`,
employing `&&` / `||` when applied to Boolean values. Previously these
optimizations were implemented directly by the `and` / `or` macros. With 
this release they are instead implemented during a compiler pass.

A consequence of moving these optimizations to the code generation phase
is that the resulting simplified `and` / `or` macros are compatibile with
code walking libraries like `core.async`.

### Support Macros that Expand to `require` Statements

This release allows macros that expand to `require` statements
to be present in the code as is illustrated in the following example:

[source,clojure]
----
(ns foo.bar
  (:require-macros [foo.baz :refer [macro-that-expands-to-require]]))
(macro-that-expands-to-require)
----

## Notable Fixes

### Support `IAssociative` `-contains-key?` Protocol Check in `contains?`

The `IAssociative` protocol defines `-contains-key?`, which facilitates 
directly testing whether a key is in an associative collection. The core
`contains?` function has been revised with this release to make such a
call for collections that implement the `IAssociative` protocol.

### Higher-Order Checked Arrays

With this release, the 
https://clojurescript.org/news/2017-07-14-checked-array-access[checked array access]
feature is extended for higher-order uses of `aget` and `aset`. For example,

[source,clojure]
----
(apply aget [(into-array [0]) 100])
----

will now trigger a warning or error at runtime if this feature is enabled via
https://clojurescript.org/reference/compiler-options#checked-arrays[compiler configuration].
